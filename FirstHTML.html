        <p>
        <strong><a href="css.html"target = "_blank">
            HyperText Markup Language</strong> or <u>HTML</u>></a> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

        <img src ="img.png" width="40%">
        </p>

        <p>

        <strong><u>Web browsers receive</u> HTML documents</strong> from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
